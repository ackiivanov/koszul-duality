# koszul-duality

Final write-up for a semester project at the University of Zürich
done with Ödül Tetik in the group of Prof. Alberto Cattaneo. It
explores the definition of Koszul duality, specifically in the
context of algebraic operads, and looks into proposed physical
applications of this duality mostly about defects. additionally,
it contains formalizations and corrections of some suggestions
from the physics literature.
